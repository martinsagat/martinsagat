I love to play team sports and one of my favorite games is Ice hockey. Team sports fuel my passion for teamwork and camaraderie. As part of a cohesive unit, I'm reminded that success depends on seamless coordination and support. Each stride on the ice reinforces the belief that together, we can overcome any obstacle and reach new heights.
