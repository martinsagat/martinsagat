Big Picture Medical is a MedTech company that specialises in digitisation of healthcare records. In this role as a Software Engineer:

- I worked alongside a team of Product Designers & Software Engineers to map user authentication features end-to-end using BPMN Workflow.
- I contributed to the SSO login features using access integration with the [National Health Care System (NHS)](https://www.nhs.uk/).
- I feature-engineered the activation mode for Medical Pathways at an organisational level, which helped Medical Practitioners to configure the fitting Medical Pathways depending on their specialisations.
- I helped expand the custom Vue-based component library called MedKit UI. Itâ€™s a library utilised across all BPM Products to ensure design consistency.
